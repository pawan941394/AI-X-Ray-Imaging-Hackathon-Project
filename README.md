## Problem Statement:  
Medical trainees and students often lack truly interactive hands-on tools for learning X-ray interpretation. Traditional resources are static, costly, or inaccessible, limiting the quality and confidence of real-world training.

MedX Tutor solves this by using generative AI to provide instant, interactive synthetic X-rays and explanations‚Äîbringing the magic of practical radiology labs to any learner, anywhere.

## Overview
MedX Tutor is a next-generation educational platform that uses Gemini AI to generate synthetic, annotated X-rays from natural language prompts. Students can...



## ‚ú® Introduction

MedX Tutor is a cutting-edge educational tool designed to bridge the gap between theoretical medical knowledge and practical radiographic interpretation. Powered by Google's Gemini AI, it allows medical students, residents, and educators to:

-   **Generate** realistic, synthetic X-ray images from simple text descriptions.
-   **Upload** existing X-ray images for detailed AI analysis.
-   **Learn** through AI-generated explanations, interactive quizzes, and a contextual chat assistant.

This project aims to provide a safe and effective environment for honing diagnostic skills without the need for real patient data.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **üìù Natural Language Prompting:** Describe a condition in plain English or Hindi (e.g., "fractured left hand"), and the AI generates a clinically accurate prompt and a corresponding X-ray.
-   **üñºÔ∏è High-Quality Image Generation:** Creates realistic, high-contrast grayscale X-ray images using the `imagen-4.0-generate-001` model.
-   **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload & Analyze:** Upload your own X-ray images for the AI to analyze and describe.
-   **üß† Detailed Explanations:** Receive structured, beginner-friendly explanations covering findings, causes, and typical treatments.
-   **‚úÖ Interactive Quizzes:** Test your knowledge with AI-generated multiple-choice questions based on the X-ray scenario.
-   **üí¨ Contextual AI Chat:** Ask follow-up questions about the X-ray, and the AI will provide answers based on the image context.
-   **üëÜ Image Explorer:** A unique point-and-ask feature. Click on any part of the image, and the AI will provide a detailed explanation and an annotated diagram of that specific area.
-   **üìÑ PDF & Image Export:** Download the generated X-ray and a comprehensive report for offline study.

## üé¨ Live Demo & Walkthrough

Here‚Äôs a quick look at the two primary workflows in MedX Tutor.


### 1. Generating an X-Ray from a Text Prompt

Simply describe the patient's condition, set the age and gender, and watch the AI bring it to life.

### 2. Uploading and Analyzing an Existing X-Ray

Upload an image from your computer, and the AI will provide a full analysis, explanation, and quiz.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: A Deeper Look


#### 1. Input & Generation
The user provides a simple description. MedX Tutor uses `gemini-2.5-flash` to refine this into a detailed clinical prompt, which is then passed to `imagen-4.0-generate-001` to create the X-ray image.

  <img src="./repo_images/3.png" alt="Input Screen" width="700">
</p>

#### 2. Analysis & Explanation
Once an image is generated or uploaded, the AI provides a comprehensive breakdown, including the clinical prompt and a structured medical explanation.

  <img src="./repo_images/4.png" alt="Explanation Screen" width="700">
</p>

#### 3. Interactive Learning Tools
Reinforce your learning with automatically generated quizzes and a contextual chat assistant that knows the specifics of the current X-ray.

</p>

#### 4. Image Explorer (Point-and-Ask)
Click anywhere on the image to open the Explorer. The AI (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`) analyzes the specific point, provides a targeted explanation, and generates a new, annotated diagram for clarity.

## ü§ñ Gemini Integration

MedX Tutor leverages a sophisticated, multi-model approach using Google's Gemini API to deliver its powerful educational features. Gemini is not just a single component but the core intelligent engine that drives every aspect of the learning experience.

-   **Text & Logic (`gemini-2.5-flash`):** The versatile and fast `gemini-2.5-flash` model handles all language-based tasks. It interprets a user's plain-language request (in English or Hindi) and transforms it into a precise clinical prompt. It then generates structured, beginner-friendly medical explanations and creates contextually relevant multiple-choice quizzes to test the user's understanding. This same model powers the conversational AI, enabling students to ask follow-up questions in a natural chat interface.

-   **Image Generation (`imagen-4.0-generate-001`):** The core visual component‚Äîthe synthetic X-ray itself‚Äîis created by `imagen-4.0-generate-001`. This state-of-the-art image generation model takes the detailed clinical prompt and renders a high-fidelity, realistic radiographic image, complete with the specified anatomy and pathology.

-   **Multimodal Analysis (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`):** The innovative "Image Explorer" feature is powered by the multimodal capabilities of `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`. When a user points to a specific area on an X-ray, this model analyzes the visual input alongside the implicit query. It then generates both a targeted textual explanation of the selected region and a brand new, annotated diagram to visually clarify the finding.

This strategic use of different Gemini models allows MedX Tutor to provide a seamless, rich, and deeply interactive educational workflow.
