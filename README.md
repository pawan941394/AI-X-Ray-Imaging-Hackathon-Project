## ‚ú® Introduction

MedX Tutor is a cutting-edge educational tool designed to bridge the gap between theoretical medical knowledge and practical radiographic interpretation. Powered by Google's Gemini AI, it allows medical students, residents, and educators to:

-   **Generate** realistic, synthetic X-ray images from simple text descriptions.
-   **Upload** existing X-ray images for detailed AI analysis.
-   **Learn** through AI-generated explanations, interactive quizzes, and a contextual chat assistant.

This project aims to provide a safe and effective environment for honing diagnostic skills without the need for real patient data.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **üìù Natural Language Prompting:** Describe a condition in plain English or Hindi (e.g., "fractured left hand"), and the AI generates a clinically accurate prompt and a corresponding X-ray.
-   **üñºÔ∏è High-Quality Image Generation:** Creates realistic, high-contrast grayscale X-ray images using the `imagen-4.0-generate-001` model.
-   **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload & Analyze:** Upload your own X-ray images for the AI to analyze and describe.
-   **üß† Detailed Explanations:** Receive structured, beginner-friendly explanations covering findings, causes, and typical treatments.
-   **‚úÖ Interactive Quizzes:** Test your knowledge with AI-generated multiple-choice questions based on the X-ray scenario.
-   **üí¨ Contextual AI Chat:** Ask follow-up questions about the X-ray, and the AI will provide answers based on the image context.
-   **üëÜ Image Explorer:** A unique point-and-ask feature. Click on any part of the image, and the AI will provide a detailed explanation and an annotated diagram of that specific area.
-   **üìÑ PDF & Image Export:** Download the generated X-ray and a comprehensive report for offline study.

## üé¨ Live Demo & Walkthrough

Here‚Äôs a quick look at the two primary workflows in MedX Tutor.

_**Note:** These are placeholder GIFs. Create your own screen recordings (we recommend using a tool like LICEcap or Kap) and replace the URLs below._

### 1. Generating an X-Ray from a Text Prompt

Simply describe the patient's condition, set the age and gender, and watch the AI bring it to life.

### 2. Uploading and Analyzing an Existing X-Ray

Upload an image from your computer, and the AI will provide a full analysis, explanation, and quiz.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: A Deeper Look

_**Note:** Replace the placeholder URLs below with actual screenshots of your application._

#### 1. Input & Generation
The user provides a simple description. MedX Tutor uses `gemini-2.5-flash` to refine this into a detailed clinical prompt, which is then passed to `imagen-4.0-generate-001` to create the X-ray image.

</p>

#### 2. Analysis & Explanation
Once an image is generated or uploaded, the AI provides a comprehensive breakdown, including the clinical prompt and a structured medical explanation.

</p>

#### 3. Interactive Learning Tools
Reinforce your learning with automatically generated quizzes and a contextual chat assistant that knows the specifics of the current X-ray.

</p>

#### 4. Image Explorer (Point-and-Ask)
Click anywhere on the image to open the Explorer. The AI (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`) analyzes the specific point, provides a targeted explanation, and generates a new, annotated diagram for clarity.

    -   `imagen-4.0-generate-001` for X-ray image generation.
    -   `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` for the Image Explorer feature.
-   **Deployment:** Designed for modern hosting platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

## üîß Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/MedX-Tutor.git
    cd MedX-Tutor
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Your project is set up to read the API key from the environment. Ensure `process.env.API_KEY` is available in your deployment environment. For local development, you might create a script to set this variable.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open the local server URL provided in your console to view it in the browser.
